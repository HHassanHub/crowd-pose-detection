# Video Analytics using Deep Learning for Massive Crowd Instant Segments and Detections
# Overview
This project aims to develop a deep learning-based solution for massive crowd segmentation and detection in video analytics. By leveraging advanced neural networks and cutting-edge computer vision techniques, the system can process and analyze crowd scenes in real-time, providing instant segmentations and detections.
# Key Features
Crowd Segmentation and Detection: Detect and segment crowds in videos using deep learning techniques.

Real-time Analysis: The system is designed to handle massive video feeds for real-time crowd analysis.

Deep Learning: Utilizes state-of-the-art models for accurate segmentation and detection in dynamic environments.

# Technologies Used
Deep Learning: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Mask R-CNN, and other advanced models for object detection and segmentation.

Python: The project is developed in Python, utilizing the deep learning ecosystem.

CVAT: CVAT (Computer Vision Annotation Tool) is used for annotating video frames for training the model.

PyCharm 3.7: The development environment used for code editing and running the project.
